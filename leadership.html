            “We can't be afraid of change. You may feel very secure in the pond you are in, but if you never venture out of it, you will never know there is such a thing as an ocean, or a sea. Holding onto something that is good for you now, may be the very reason why you don't change and have something even better.”

            <h2>CSE Tutor</h2>
            <p>I have been a tutor for <b>CSE 12 Basic Data Structures</b>, one of the most foundational CS courses at UC San Diego, for approaching three years. As a tutor, I have supported and guided <i>nearly 2500 students</i> through fostering good coding practices like clean code, debugging skills, and visualizing concepts, helping students build a strong base for their future coursework. Witnessing their progress and receiving positive feedback confirmed that my <em>individualized teaching approach</em> and patience made a meaningful impact.</p>
