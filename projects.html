                                    <p><dfn>SamBamViz</dfn> is a tool, built by Professor Moshiri, that generates a spreadsheet containing the number of As, Cs, Gs, Ts, and gaps in each position from a read mapping (SAM/BAM) file. However, it is difficult to make big picture inferences about the output, which poses a problem for public health officials who do not have the experience or resources to analyze such data. I developed a user-friendly web application that visualizes SamBamViz’s output in order to effectively gain a better insight from these viral genomic sequences.</p>

                        <h3>EMPress Compression</h3>
                        <p><dfn>EMPress</dfn> is an “interactive web tool,” built by Kalen Cantrell from the UCSD's Center of Microbiome Innovation, for graphing phylogenetic trees. Unfortunately, EMPress crashes and is unable to handle larger trees with around two million nodes. I implemented data compression techniques using JavaScript, Gzip, and Pako Inflation to load large data into EMPress, by primarily targeting the compression of three crucial pieces of data in loading the tree (tree, names, and lengths arrays). This method led to 5x increase in the number of nodes that can be visualized by trees.</p>

                        <p>I conducted a systematic review, aiming to synthesize quantitative observations from peer-reviewed primary sources to establish trends in the effect of laminar shear stress on the molecule  KLF2 mRNA expression. The goal of this study is to create an informative and applicable database to store article details, experimental designs, and quantitative measurements for the molecule KLF2. Visual representations and regression analysis demonstrated an overall lack of uniformity in experimental design and protocols in the field and noted potential areas to study in order to advance heart disease prevention and treatment.</p>

                        <h3>Quantitative Consensus Models for Cardiovascular Mechanobiology</h3>
                        <p>As the leading cause of death in the U.S., it has become increasingly important to advance research on cardiovascular disease (CVD) treatment. One way is by tackling molecular responses to mechanical forces (i.e., shear stress) on blood vessels. While there are countless studies on these molecules’ relations to shear stress in endothelial cells, there is an absence of consensus and applicable quantitative models and descriptions of these molecules. Using a systematic meta-analysis to synthesize quantitative data from peer-reviewed primary sources, my goal was to create a semi-automated database to predict responses against hemodynamic forces and effectively design future experiments to advance research in CVD. The results of my study suggested the need for more consistent experimental designs and gene nomenclature across studies & point out the molecules on which we lack knowledge.</p>

The project involved building a robust database architecture using PostgreSQL, Java, JSPs, and Apache Tomcat. I designed and implemented over 35 relational schemas, created more than 25 dynamic data entry forms, and developed 8 key queries and reports to support efficient data retrieval and management.</p>

Over 3 million students in the US have dyslexia, and it remains the most common learning disability worldwide. I orchestrated the development of Clover, an educational app comprised of structured literacy-based games and tools that can help students with dyslexia. With Android Studio, Java, and Github basics, I led software development and produced layout and asset designs to create a simple yet visually appealing app. With enjoyable and engaging games and other features, our app is designed to fit the individual proficiency level of a student.</p>
